# 10 Codility tasks in Haskell

This project is a learning project that contains a few codility.com tasks solved in Haskell. The tasks cannot be checked via codility right now. So some tests for implementations are also provided.

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```
